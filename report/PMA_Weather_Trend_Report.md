## 3. Model Results  

### Baseline Models (Notebook 02 ‚Äì Univariate Lag)  
| Model                     | RMSE   | MAE   | MAPE (%) | R¬≤    |  
|---------------------------|--------|-------|----------|-------|  
| Naive (lag-1)             | 10.54  | 9.58  | 44.22    | -1.85 |  
| Linear Regression (lag-1) | 8.98   | 7.66  | 32.32    | -1.07 |  

‚ö†Ô∏è High errors and negative R¬≤ ‚Üí lag-only models fail to capture variability.

### Multivariate Models (Notebook 03 ‚Äì Engineered Features)  
| Model               | RMSE   | MAE   | MAPE (%) | R¬≤   |  
|---------------------|--------|-------|----------|------|  
| Ridge Regression    | 2.32   | 1.80  | 8.73     | 0.86 |  
| Random Forest       | 2.54   | 1.94  | 8.88     | 0.83 |  
| **Ensemble (R+RF)** | **2.31** | **1.79** | **8.47** | **0.86** |  

‚úÖ RMSE reduced by ~75% compared to baselines.  
‚úÖ Ensemble provided the best balance of accuracy and stability.

### Anomaly & Spatial Analysis (Notebook 04)  
| City   | Mean Temp (¬∞C) | Std Dev | Uni-anomaly Rate | Multi-anomaly Rate |  
|--------|----------------|---------|------------------|--------------------|  
| Tokyo  | 27.9           | 4.7     | 53%              | 37%                |  
| London | 18.5           | 3.2     | 45%              | 53%                |  

- **Tokyo:** Higher averages, fewer anomalies.  
- **London:** Cooler temps but higher anomaly rates ‚Üí more complex variability.

## 4. Weather Trends & Insights  

- **Seasonality:** Strong annual cycles with predictable summer/winter swings.  
- **Drivers:** Lagged temperature, humidity, and pressure were most influential.  
- **City Differences:**  
  - Tokyo ‚Üí Strong seasonality, moderate anomaly rates.  
  - London ‚Üí Milder temps, higher multivariate anomalies.  
- **Precipitation:** Highly irregular but city-specific (Tokyo wetter than London).
